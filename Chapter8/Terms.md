- built-in types: types come with the programming language such as int, double, char, etc
- enumerator: element inside an enumeration type 
- representation: value that represent the data of an object
- class: user-defined types
- helper function: a function provide a useful operation on an object of a class
- struct: user-defined type in case that we just handle with plain data. 
- const: 
- implementation: details logics of an operation
- structure:
- constructor: its used to initialize for an object
- in-class initializer: that is default data member
- user-defined types: which is not built-in types
- destructor: 
- inlining: compiler replaces function body directly when execute the function without jumping to that function and return, etc to help boost performance.
- valid state: values of an object that we can say they are valid depending on our definition.
- enum: keyword to define an enumeration
- interface: what users can access to an object
- enumeration: another way besides class to build user-defined types
- invariant: rules defining what is valid state for an object
- enum class: define scoped enumeration
- operator overloading: providing operators for user-defined types operands
- default member initializer: data member of a class which compiler will pick up to use inside constructors if that constructor does not explicitly initialize that member.
