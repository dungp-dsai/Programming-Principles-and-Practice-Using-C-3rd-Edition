- activation record: records local variables, parameter list and implementation stuff
- function: named a set of statements doing specific computation.
- pass-by-reference: function arguments refer to address of actual variables rather than copy the values into new values to pass into the function
- argument: what is passed into a function 
- function definition: this is where we specify detailed implementation of a function, where we write function body
- pass-by-value: arguments of functions copy new values when we pass into a function.
- argument passing: 
- global scope: outter most scope in a program
- recursion: function calles itself
- call stack: contains set of activation record, it records which functions are called in what order. And destroyes activation record with the order last in first out after completing a function execution. 
- header file: 
- return: keyword used to return values from a function
- class scope: what within a class
- initializer: initial values when we define a name
- return value: output of a function 
- const: a keyword used to define pass-by-const-reference
- local scope: what within {} or a function parameter
- scope: region of text 
- constexpr: keyword used to specify things to run at the compile-time.
- namespace: a concept to group things like function, class, data types into an indentifiable part without defining a type. 
- statement scope: such as in for statement 
- declaration: introduce a name into a scope
- namespace scope: what inside a namespace
- technicalities: details specific to a programming languages. 
- definition: allocate memory to a name 
- nested block: block inside block
- undeclared identifier: 
- extern: keyword use to declare a name which is defined elsewhere
- parameter: is often called formal argument. what is passed into a function.
- using declaration: an approach to declare a name within a namespace to shorten the fully qualified name 
- forward declaration: 
- pass-by-const-reference: argument refers to an address with read-only permission
- using directive: force a name refer to a namespace.
- auto: keyword to deduce return type in a function definition
- −>: trailing return notation 
- suffix return type: instead of return type at the beginning in function declaration or definition, we can put it after parameter list.
